# Finding cut vertices algorithm
This is algorithm to find all cut vertices in the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The program reads all graph adjacents from text input file.

# Adjacents input file
Adjacents of vertices are separated by comma as shown in example intput files, input.txt and input2.txt

# Compilation
To compile it, run:
```
	make clean
	make
```

Then, run it by using command:
```
	./run
```
